### 1. About this project

In this project I have built a multiple linear regression model which will be able to accurately predict house prices in the area of the dataset - King County. First, I explore and clean the data. Then I move to feature selection and engineering. At the end I build and compare several models and select the optimal one.

### 2. About the dataset

The dataset consists of data from Zillow on house prices and house features in King County, Washington. It contains information, such as the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, size of living area and the adjecent lot, number of floors, condition and zipcode.
